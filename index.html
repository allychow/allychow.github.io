            <h4>January-March 2020</h4>
            <p>
                I got to work on the new Facebook website with the Media Sharing team. Learning to use <strong>GraphQL and React</strong>, I helped make the composer performant and ready for launch.
                <br /><br />
                The biggest thing I built was a new user experience for adding backgrounds to text posts across the Facebook website. After being A/B tested, <strong>this experience is currently live</strong> for all users of the Facebook website!

                You'll see some of my smaller features on the composer (and hopefully you'll see none of the bugs I fixed).

            <h3>Riot Games - Software Engineer Intern</h3>
            <h4>May-August 2019</h4>
            <p>
                I worked on the League of Legends client as a part of the
                Growth team this past summer. Using
                <strong>C++, JavaScript, Ember, Stylus and Handlebars</strong>, I helped build components on hubs for
                Teamfight Tactics
                and new players. I also worked on a brand new hub meant to welcome back players who were just coming
                back to the game after a while away!

                <br /><br />

                <br /><br />

                <img class="asset" src="src/assets/newplayerhub.png" />

                <br /><br />
                The
                <strong>Teamfight Tactics hub is currently live</strong>,
                and is the primary out-of-game experience for TFT players to
                complete missions and get rewards. <br /><br />
                <img class="asset" src="src/assets/TFThub.png" />
                <br /><br />
                The final thing I built was a screen integrated with the new
                player flow that allowed players coming to the client just
                for TFT to skip the regular League tutorial paths. This
                screen has been used by
                <strong>over 3 million players</strong> to date, fixing a
                big player pain for new TFT players! <br /><br />

            <h3>Microsoft - Software Engineer Intern</h3>
            <h4>August-December 2018 <br />January-April 2018</h4>
            <p>
                I spent my first three co-op terms at Microsoft. For the
                second and third co-op, I was a software intern on the
                Flighting team. We built the tooling that allowed beta and
                A/B testing of operating system and device features, as well
                as tooling that helped Microsoft's developers test their
                features faster.

                <br /><br />

                I worked on web dashboards with
                <strong>C#, Angular 1.x, React, and TypeScript</strong>, I
                worked a bit in the backend implementing a
                <strong>Redis cache</strong>, and I also worked on a desktop
                app with <strong>C#, XAML and C++</strong>.

                <br /><br />

                I wrote more about what I loved about Microsoft's intern
                experience

            <h3>Microsoft - Explore Intern</h3>
            <h4>May-September 2017</h4>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, was at Microsoft - but this first time
                was as an Explore Intern.

                <br /><br />

                The Explore program is really great because it's meant for
                people with little to no experience - which was perfect
                because I had pretty much none! I spent an amazing 16 weeks
                learning what it meant to be a PM, and learning how to do
                web development.

                <br /><br />

                My pod and I spec'd out our project, designed the UI, built
                it with the help of our mentor, and went on to roll out our
                dashboard to users!

                <br /><br />
